        <a href="https://clojars.org/org.clojars.stiwar/datest">Datest</a> is a data oriented unit testing framework for clojure.
        This page will serve as its documentation.
    </p>
    <h2>Distinguishing features</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Designed to be used from REPL</li>
      <li>Test suites and test results are clojure values that you can manipulate in the REPL</li>
      <li>Works with both clojure and clojurescript</li>
      <li>Cleans stack traces to only contain frames from your module</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Defining a test suite</h2>
    <p>
        <progi>testing</progi> macro is used to define the test suite tree. The leaf nodes in this tree will contain the
        testing logic and the inner nodes will be used to group multiple test suites. An invocation of the
        <progi>testing</progi> macro returns a test suite as a value:
    </p>
    <prog>
(def suite1 (testing :test []
                    {:result :OK
                     :message "A simple test suite"))
    </prog>
    <p>
        The first argument to the macro is the name of the test suite (<progi>:test</progi> in this case). How the rest
        of the arguments are interpreted depends on whether the test suite is a leaf node or an inner node.
    </p>
    <h3>Leaf Nodes</h3>
    <p>
        Leaf nodes must have a vector after the name. The above example is a leaf node. As you can see, it looks
        like a function call. You are supposed to put all the testing logic inside these "functions". It must return a
        clojure map with <progi>:result</progi> as a key. It can throw an exception as well. The test result will have the
        stack trace with unnecessary stack frames filtered out (clojure.core, clojure.lang, etc).<br/>
        The empty vector isn't there just for marking the leaf nodes. I'll describe how to use them later.
    </p>
    <h3>Inner Nodes</h3>
    <p>
        Inner nodes must contain nested <progi>testing</progi> macro calls following the name:
    </p>
    <prog>
(def suite2 (testing :a
                     (testing :b []
                              {:result :OK})
                     (testing :c []
                              {:result  :ERR
                               :message "failing test"})
                     (testing :d []
                              (throw (new Error))
                              {:result  :OK
                               :message "ignored"}) ))
    </prog>
    <h2>Manipulating test suites</h2>
    <p>
        You can combine multiple test suites into a single suite using <progi>combine-tests</progi> function:
    </p>
    <prog>
(def combined (combine-tests [suite1 suite2]))
    </prog>
    <p>
        You can define parts of test suite in different modules and combine them into one big suite in
        the main testing module.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also pull out parts of the test suite because it's a regular clojure map:
    </p>
    <prog>
(def suite3 (get combined :test))
(def suite4 (get-in combined [:a :c]))
    </prog>
    <p>
        This can be used to run a subset of the full test suite.
    </p>
    <h2>Running test suites</h2>
    <p>
        <progi>run-test</progi> function can be used to execute a test suite. It returns a result tree whose structure
        matches that of the given test suite.
    </p>
    <prog>
(run-test combined)
{:test {:result :OK,
        :message "A simple test suite"},
 :a {:b {:result :OK},
     :c {:result :ERR,
         :message "failing test"},
     :d {:result :EXCEPTION,
         :exception #error}}}

(run-test (get-in combined [:a :c]))
{:result :ERR, :message "failing test"}
    </prog>

    <h2>Test state</h2>
    <p>
        Consider the following test unit:
    </p>
    <prog>
(testing :suite []
         (let [a (get_a)
               b (get_b a)]
           (if (valid_value? b)
             {:result :OK}
             {:result :ERR
              :cause  "Invalid result"
              :a      a
              :b      b})))
    </prog>
    <p>
        What if <progi>get-b</progi> throws an exception. You'll get the following result when you execute this test:
    </p>
    <prog>
{:result    :EXCEPTION
 :exception #error}
    </prog>
    <p>
        The exception info will contain the stack trace, but not the value of local variable <progi>a</progi> that
        caused <progi>get-b</progi> to throw an exception.
    </p>
    <p>
        Datest has the concept of state variables that can help with this. The state variables for a test unit are
        declared in the argument vector of the "function" for that test unit:
    </p>
    <prog>
(testing :suite [val_a]
         (let [a (get_a)
               _ (reset! val_a a)
               b (get_b a)]
           (if (valid_value? b)
             {:result :OK}
             {:result :ERR
              :cause  "Invalid result"
              :a      a
              :b      b})))
    </prog>
    <p>
        The execution context of the test unit will have an atom for each state variable that is declared. You can store
        intermediate state of the test unit inside these atoms, and this state will be available in the test result:
    </p>
    <prog>
{:suite {:result :EXCEPTION,
         :exception #error,
         :state {val_a 1}}}
    </prog>

    <h2>Utilities</h2>
    <p>
      <progi>get-failed</progi> : Return test results with <progi>(not= status :OK)</progi>:
    </p>
    <prog>
(get-failed (run-test combined))
{:a {:c {:result :ERR, :message "failing test"},
     :d {:result :EXCEPTION,
         :exception #error}}}
    </prog>
    <p>
        <progi>flatten-result/treefy-result</progi> : Can be used to iterate over test results:
    </p>
    <prog>
(->> (run-test combined)
     flatten-result
     (filter my-result-filter)
     treefy-result)
    </prog>
    <prog>
(def failed (flatten-result (get-failed (run-test combined))))

; number of failed results
(count failed)

; first failed test:
(first failed)

; stats about test results
(frequencies (map :result (flatten-result (run-test combined))))
{:OK 2, :ERR 1, :EXCEPTION 1}
    </prog>
    <p>
      <progi>return-comparison</progi> : Compare two objects and return a result with their comparison:
    </p>
    <prog>
(run-test (testing :test []
                   (let [expected {:a {:b 1
                                       :c 3}}
                         actual {:a {:b 1
                                     :c 4}}]
                     (return-comparison expected actual))))
=>
{:test {:main {:result :ERR,
               :expected {:a {:b 1, :c 3}},
               :actual {:a {:b 1, :c 4}},
               :diff ({:a {:c 3}} {:a {:c 4}} {:a {:b 1}}),
               :state {}}}}
    </prog>
    <p>
        <progi>:diff</progi> sequence is the result of <progi>clojure.data/diff</progi>. First element is data that is only
        in expected response, second element is data only in actual response, third element is common data.
