  If you look in the game assets of Delta Force: Black Hawk Down, you'll see some sbf files (<progi>menumus.sbf</progi>,
  <progi>gamemus.sbf</progi>, <progi>EXP1.sbf</progi>) that store the music tracks. I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/amokfa/dfbhd_mus">program</a>
  that converts the tracks inside these files to mp3. This page discusses the structure of these files.
  You can listen to the results <a href="/posts/dfbhd_mus.html">here</a>. Note that all the information in this page was
  acquired through reverse engineering. Some of it might be wrong. If you find any glitches in the output music files,
  create an issue.
  </p>

  <h2>Header and index</h2>
  <p>
    Each SBF file starts with a header of this format:

  <prog>
struct SBFHeader {
    magic: [u8; 4],
    i1: u32,
    i2: u32,
    i3: u32,
    index_offset: u32,
    index_count: u32
}
  </prog>
    The magic is always "SBF0" in ascii. I didn't find any significance of i1, i2, i3. Index offset and index count
    declare the location of the index of music tracks in this file. Each index entry has this format:
  <prog>
struct SBFIndexEntryBin {
    ident: [u8; 8],
    z1: u32,
    z2: u32,
    start: u32,
    size: u32,
    block_size: u32,
    z3: u32,
}
  </prog>
    ident is again an ascii identifier. z1, z2, z3 are always zero. start and size declare the location of that music entry
    inside the file. block_size is always 4104 (= 4096 + 8), and size is always a multiple of block_size. So the segment
    of file between start and (start + size) is a list of chunks of size 4104. The track identifiers are named like this:
    (MARKA001, MARKA002, ...). Marka breakdown is the first mission of the game. So all the segments of a mission need to
    be extracted, grouped, and the sound data of all these segments is to be concatenated.
  </p>

  <h2>Chunk format</h2>
  <p>
    Each segment has a list of chunks of this format:
    <prog>
struct SBFChunkData {
    size: u32,
    scale1: u8,
    scale2: u8,
    two_fifty: u8,
    zero: u8,
    content: [u8; 4096]
}
    </prog>
    content is the actual PCM data. size is always 4096, except for the chunks at the tail of a segment, meaning it's the
    count of valid bytes inside the chunk.
  </p>
  <p>
    Experimentation reveals the PCM data format is unsigned 8 bit, 2 channel, at
    22050Hz sample rate. If you convert it to mp3 based on this spec, you get something like this:
  </p>
  <audio controls preload="metadata" loud src="/static/media/dfbhd_unprocessed.mp3" preload="none"></audio>
  <p>
    It has the right rhythm but the amplitude is all over the place. It turns out the scale fields in the chunk header
    are modifiers that needs to be applied to the PCM data to get proper sounding audio. The digital signal needs to be
    divided by <formula>\(2^{scale}\)</formula>. I scaled the signal up to signed 16 bit and applied this modifier to
    get the result linked above.
  </p>
  <h2>Why did they encode it like this?</h2>
  <p>
    The decision to choose 8 bit PCM was clearly a space optimization. But the problem with 8 bit audio is precision.
    There are only 256 values that the amplitude can have. For parts of the track where the volume is relatively loud,
    this isn't that big of a problem, but it adds a lot of noise to the quieter parts of the track and sounds worse.
    (relative difference between 1 and 2 is much bigger than difference between 115 and 116). For example, this is a
    downscaled 8 bit version of the first track in the list. Notice the hissing and cracking in the first few seconds.
  </p>
  <audio controls preload="metadata" src="/static/media/dfbhd_downscaled.mp3" preload="none"></audio>
  <p>
    This is unacceptable because this game has a lot of ambient music (e.g. <progi>GASA</progi> track).
  </p>
  <p>
    Their solution was to divide the tracks into 4096 byte chunks, which stores around 100ms of sound, use full
    256 level precision for quiet parts as well, and add metadata to the chunk describing how it must be scaled
    in a high precision space to get the final result.
  </p>
  <h2>Why didn't they just use mp3?</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/oc645j/is_it_safe_to_use_the_mp3_format_in_games_in_2021/">mp3 was
    under a patent until 2017</a>. Maybe they didn't want to bother with the licensing.
    Ogg vorbis is a free alternative but it came out in 2000. Considering the game came out in 2003, they might have already
    implemented this solution by the time ogg became popular.
