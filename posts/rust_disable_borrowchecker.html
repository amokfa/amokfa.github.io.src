    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
        LogLog Games is an indie game studio that moved from unity to rust 3 years ago. They wrote their own
        game engine in rust and developed and published a game using it as well. Recently they decided to abandon
        rust and move back to unity. They wrote an <a target="_blank" href="https://loglog.games/blog/leaving-rust-gamedev">article</a>
        sharing their reasons for this decision. A lot of the reasons could be boiled down to the statement that rust
        borrow checker is too strict. The compiler will reject valid programs because it cannot prove that they are safe
        in the framework defined by the creators of the rust language. This is one of the example they used (in the
        section "Abstraction isn't a choice"):
    </p>
    <prog>
if let Some(character) = &self.selected_duck {
    character_select_duck_detail(.., character, self);
} else {
    character_select_no_duck(...);
}
    </prog>
    <p>
        Here they are taking a reference to the field <progi>selected_duck</progi> and in the next line they are passing
        <progi>self</progi> to a function. The compilation fails because the function takes a mutable reference
        to <progi>self</progi>, and rustc won't allow that because there is already an immutable reference to a field of
        <progi>self</progi> in scope. This code won't compile even if <progi>character_select_duck_detail</progi> isn't
        mutating the field of <progi>self</progi> that has been borrowed. The compiler/optimizer simply isn't smart enough to take that into account.
        So you need to refactor your code to satisfy the compiler. Their argument is that sometimes that refactoring
        results in suboptimal code. Even if the refactoring doesn't result in suboptimal code, a lot of times it's completely
        unnecessary and just adds unneeded burden on the programmer. The model you have of your code in your head might
        not be the same as the model borrow checker has of your code and in those situations it's just a distraction.
    </p>
    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>
        However, there is a way you can turn off the borrow checker if you are fairly sure that the errors it's giving
        you are false positives. I have a couple utility functions that do this:
    </p>
    <prog>
pub fn ms&lt;T: ?Sized>(r : &T) -> &'static T {
    unsafe { std::mem::transmute::&lt;_, &'static T>(r) }
}

pub fn mm&lt;T: ?Sized>(r : &T) -> &mut T {
    #[allow(mutable_transmutes)]
    unsafe { std::mem::transmute::&lt;_, &mut T>(r) }
}
    </prog>
    <p>
        These functions takes a pointer as input, and gives another pointer as output. The output is the same pointer,
        the same 8 bytes representing a location in memory, but with a different type.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Rust veterans will disagree with me here. A reference is not the same thing as a pointer. But it looks like a
        pointer and quacks like a pointer, so I'm using it like a pointer.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        <progi>ms</progi> stands for make static. It takes a regular pointer and gives back a static pointer. Static
        pointers have infinite lifetime, so if the compiler is complaining about a lifetime error which you know is
        not an issue, you can wrap that usage with this function and the compiler will stop complaining. For example,
        this is some graphics code from a game I'm writing:
    </p>
    <prog>
if frame_idx % 30 == 0 {
    let gfx = ms(&gfx);
    let screenshot = ms(&screenshot);
    std::thread::spawn(|| {
        gfx.screenshot.slice(..).map_async(MapMode::Read, |t| {
            screenshot.lock().unwrap().copy_from_slice(&gfx.screenshot.slice(..).get_mapped_range()[..]);
            gfx.screenshot.unmap();
        });
    });
}
    </prog>
    <p>
        The engine takes a screenshot every 0.5s and uses it to show the color under the cursor. I use it to debug rendering
        issues. If you remove lines 2 and 3 the compiler will start complaining about lifetimes. It will say that the
        launched thread might outlive these objects and then I will get a use after free bug. What the compiler doesn't
        know is that these objects live as long as the game. So I use <progi>ms</progi> to silence the compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
        I could wrap these objects with <progi>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;>></progi> but it feels unnecessary in this case. I did put
        the screenshot buffer inside a mutex for correctness' sake but even that isn't necessary. There are millions of pixels on the
        screen and a write happens only once every 0.5s. The probability that a pixel will be written to while we are reading
        it is very low. Even then the pixel color we read will be a blend of the RGBA values of the previous frame and the
        next frame and will only look like that for one frame, assuming the buffer is not overwritten in multiples of 4 bytes, in which case even that won't happen.
        Rust gives you guaranteed memory and thread safety, but you might not even need that in many cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        <progi>mm</progi> stands for make mutable. It takes a constant pointer and returns a mutable pointer. This function
        can be used to deal with the example they used. <progi>self</progi> can be wrapped with this function to convert
        it into a mutable pointer. From the borrow checkers point of view the code is creating two immutable references
        to <progi>self</progi> which is allowed:
    </p>
    <prog>
if let Some(character) = &self.selected_duck {
    character_select_duck_detail(.., character, mm(self));
} else {
    character_select_no_duck(...);
}
    </prog>
    <p>
        Of course this is about as far away from conventional rust as you could go. If you use these utilities, rustc
        cannot guarantee memory safety in your programs. Warranty void if seal broken. You will get segmentation faults,
        use after free bugs, data races, UB, the whole bunch, if you aren't careful. But then some programmers believe the memory bugs are just
        another class of bugs that you are supposed to weed out before shipping.
    </p>
    <h2>Should you write rust like this?</h2>
    <p>
        You shouldn't program a tls library the same way you program a video game. Vice verse, you shouldn't have to program a video game the same way you program a tls library.
        Video game programming is distinct due to its significant emphasis on extensive prototyping. You need to prototype <em>a lot</em> to
        figure out what looks good and feels fun. Many games stay in the prototyping phase right upto the release date. That's when the
        developers clean everything up and ship it to the users. As evident by the article written by LogLog games, rust
        is <em>very</em> hostile to such programming patterns. And if you're building a single player game, it doesn't really
        matter if the program crashes once during a runtime of 100 years, which translates to 10 out of a million players seeing
        the crash once if they finish it in 10 hours. You need to see if that level of reliability is worth the
        loss of ergonomics which rust forces on you for your particular use case. Not to mention that a user will not gain anything by hacking the vulnerabilities in his single player game.
        It would be a good idea to write safe code in the netcode of a multiplayer game though, because that is likely the component that
        the cheaters will attack.
    </p>
    <p>
        For many command-line utilities, it doesn't matter if your program has vulnerabilities or concurrency bugs either, except for how they affect the user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you're writing rust like this, you'll have to maintain a list of unchecked invariants in your mind about your program. This is where
        the memory and concurrency bugs will originate from. It would be a good idea to write them down as well, or encode them
        in the structure of a program. And the larger your team size is, the more likely it will be that you'll either forget
        to document these invariants properly, or someone will not understand them properly and cause problems. And the chances
        of seeing memory bugs will increase.
    </p>
    <p>
        It would definitely be a bad idea to write a library like this and publish it for others to use. I would be very hesitant
        to use a rust library whose code is written like this. It's very likely that the author of that library hasn't
        considered all the ways in which people will use that library, and someone will use that library in a way it wasn't
        intended, and introduce a bug in their program. But for moderately sized <em>applications</em> where security/reliability
        isn't one of the main concerns, or you want/need to be able to prototype very quickly, there are little to no reasons
        for not programming like this.
