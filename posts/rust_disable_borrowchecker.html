        LogLog Games is an indie game studio that moved from unity to rust 3 years ago. They wrote their own
        game engine in rust and developed and published a game using it as well. Recently they decided to abandon
        rust and move back to unity. They wrote an <a href="https://loglog.games/blog/leaving-rust-gamedev">article</a>
        sharing their reasons for this decision. A lot of the reasons could be boiled down to the statement that rust
        borrow checker is too strict. The compiler will reject valid programs because it cannot prove that they are safe
        in the framework defined by the creators of the rust language. This is one of the example they used (in the
        section "Abstraction isn't a choice"):
    </p>
    <prog>
if let Some(character) = &self.selected_duck {
    character_select_duck_detail(.., character, self);
} else {
    character_select_no_duck(...);
}
    </prog>
    <p>
        Here they are taking a reference to the field <progi>selected_duck</progi> and in the next line they are passing
        <progi>self</progi> to a function. The compilation fails apparently because the function takes a mutable reference
        to <progi>self</progi>, and rustc won't allow that because there is already an immutable reference to a field of
        <progi>self</progi> in scope. This code won't compile even if <progi>character_select_duck_detail</progi> isn't
        mutating the field of <progi>self</progi> that has been borrowed. The compiler just isn't smart enough to see
        this. So you need to refactor your code to satisfy the compiler. And sometimes that refactoring results in
        suboptimal code. Even if the refactoring doesn't result in suboptimal code, a lot of times it's completely
        unnecessary and just adds unneeded burden on the programmer. The model you have of your code in your head might
        not be the same as the model borrow checker has of your code and in those situations it's just a distraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, there is a way you can turn off the borrow checker if you are fairly sure that the errors it's giving
        you are false positives. I have a couple utility functions that do this:
    </p>
    <prog>
pub fn ms&lt;T: ?Sized>(r : &T) -> &'static T {
    unsafe { std::mem::transmute::&lt;_, &'static T>(r) }
}

pub fn mm&lt;T: ?Sized>(r : &T) -> &mut T {
    #[allow(mutable_transmutes)]
    unsafe { std::mem::transmute::&lt;_, &mut T>(r) }
}

pub fn msm&lt;T: ?Sized>(r : &mut T) -> &'static mut T {
    unsafe { std::mem::transmute::&lt;_, &'static mut T>(r) }
}
    </prog>
    <p>
        These functions takes a pointer as input, and gives another pointer as output. The output is the same pointer,
        the same 8 bytes representing a location in memory, but with a different type.
    </p>
    <p>
        <progi>ms</progi> stands for make static. It takes a regular pointer and gives back a static pointer. Static
        pointers have infinite lifetime, so if the compiler is complaining about a lifetime error which you know is
        not an issue, you can wrap that usage with this function and the compiler will stop complaining. For example,
        this is some graphics code from a game I'm writing:
    </p>
    <prog>
if frame_idx % 30 == 0 {
    let gfx = ms(&gfx);
    let screenshot = ms(&screenshot);
    std::thread::spawn(|| {
        gfx.screenshot.slice(..).map_async(MapMode::Read, |t| {
            screenshot.lock().unwrap().copy_from_slice(&gfx.screenshot.slice(..).get_mapped_range()[..]);
            gfx.screenshot.unmap();
        });
    });
}
    </prog>
    <p>
        The engine takes a screenshot every 0.5s and uses it to show the color under the cursor. I use it to debug rendering
        bugs. If you remove lines 2 and 3 the compiler will start complaining about lifetimes. It will say that the
        launched thread might outlive these objects and then I will get a use after free bug. What the compiler doesn't
        know is that these objects live as long as the game. So I use <progi>ms</progi> to silence the compiler. I could
        wrap these objects with <progi>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;>></progi> but it is completely unnecessary in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
        <progi>mm</progi> stands for make mutable. It takes a constant pointer and returns a mutable pointer. This function
        can be used to deal with the example they used. <progi>self</progi> can be wrapped with this function to convert
        it into a mutable pointer. From the borrow checkers point of view the code is creating two immutable references
        to <progi>self</progi> which is allowed:
    </p>
    <prog>
if let Some(character) = &self.selected_duck {
    character_select_duck_detail(.., character, mm(self));
} else {
    character_select_no_duck(...);
}
    </prog>
    <p>
        Of course this method is about as far away from conventional rust as you could go. If you use these utilities, rustc
        cannot guarantee the memory safety in your programs. Warranty void if seal broken. You will get segmentation faults,
        use after free bugs, data races, UB etc if you aren't careful. But then some programmers view the memory bugs as just
        another class of bugs that you are supposed to weed out before shipping.
